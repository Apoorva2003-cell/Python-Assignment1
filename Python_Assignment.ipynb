        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   >>  python is multi purpose programming language , it is used to interact with the computer , for software programs and iit is very popular because it is easy to understand because of its syntax and alot of libraries are present in the python and this language is widely using in the industry because of it's versatile nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   >>  Python is a high level programming language ,so interpreter is a program which converts the high level program into machine code, and this interpreter convert the code line by line.\n",
        "  \n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   >> Predefine keywords are the keywords that are already reserved in the python and hold a specific meaning and that meaning cannot be changed , it is  used to define the syntax of coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   >>Keywords cannot be named as variable because keywords are already reserved by python and hold a specific meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   >> In python , mutability refers to  whether an object's value can be changed after it's created. mutuable objects can be changed , we can modify  the object . ex: list, dictionaries and sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   >>lists are mutable which means after creating the list we can modify the list but sets are immutable which means we cannot modify the sets once it has been created because they are meant to used for fixed collection items that shouldn't change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   >> The \"==\" is compares the value of two objects,it checks two objects are equal  whereas \"is\" operator checks if two variables point to the same object, checks if two variable are identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   >> The logical operators in python are keywords that combine  and evaluate multiple condition in single expression , it will give boolean expression that's why it is also known as boolean operators. three types of logical operators are there:\n",
        "   1>and: Returns  true if both statements are correct\n",
        "   2>or: Returns true if either one condition is true.\n",
        "   3>not: Reverse the condition , returning false if reult is true\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   >> Typecasting is a process to convert the one data type to another.this can be implicit and explicit datatype\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    >>Implicit typecasting- This occurs when python automatically convert one data type to another without any external instruction from the programmer.\n",
        "    >> Explicit typecasting- This involves converting a datatype explicity using predefined functions like int(), float(), str() etc , where the programmer specifically directs the type of conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    >> The purpose of the conditional statement  in python to control the flow of execution by using the different code block based on certain conditions.\n",
        "   - A conditional statement executes the block of code ig the given condition is true.\n",
        "    - If the conditiona is false , the code is not executed.\n",
        "    - conditional statements are also known as decision making statements\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    >> In python, elif is the short form of if-else and is used when if statement is not true and when we need to check more condition, there is no limit of elif statements we can use in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "     >> The difference between for loop and while loop in python is that for allows intialization, condition checking and iteration  statement at the top of the loop whereas while only allows initialization and condition cheking at the top of the loop.for loop is entry controlled loop, while loop is exit controlled is an exit controlled loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    >> For loop is used when the number of iteration is known , whereas while is ideal for the situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on some dynamic conditions.\n",
